## Mailcow - simple tools that use the mailcow API

Currently there a two tools [addMailboxes](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/tree/master/addMailboxes) and addSyncJobs (soon). 
I made them for my own use and maybe it is useful to someone else. 

I am not affiliated with mailcow in any way. 

More infos about [mailcow](https://mailcow.email/) and the [mailcow API](https://mx.mailcow.email/api/). 

Support mailcow it is great :-) !
