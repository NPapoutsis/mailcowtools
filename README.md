## Mailcow tools - simple tools that use the mailcow API

Currently there a the following tools:

- [addMailboxes](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/tree/master/addMailboxes)
- [updateQuota](https://github.com/appcoders/mailcowtools/tree/master/updateQuota)
- addSyncJobs (soon). 

I made them for my own use and maybe they are useful to someone else. 

I am not affiliated with mailcow in any way. 

More infos about [mailcow](https://mailcow.email/) and the [mailcow API](https://mx.mailcow.email/api/).
